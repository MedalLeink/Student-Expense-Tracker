2. In Canvas, submit this completed text file, your Python program, your
Python test file, and any project data files such as .txt and .csv files and
link to video walkthrough if needed.

        In Canvas, I submitted this completed project report text file, my Python
        program file, my Python test file, and the CSV data file used by the
        program. No external libraries or complex setups were required, so a
        video walkthrough was not needed.
